# Console_tetris_cpp

A little program that I programmed to learn and practice c++. The program doesn't use the Windows.h, but ncurses.h. 

## Run it

Compile it:
``` sh
    make run
```
Or just run it:
``` sh
    ./a.out
```

## Credits and help:
I learned how to rotate the index of the pieces from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OK8_tHeCIA).
